## Description

The webpage should very closely resemble the template page that was given.

I did make one adjustment to the text size - much of the text in the template was 22px, and I chose to use a standard default of 16px, with all other text scaled proportionally.

I used a SASS compiler with .scss files to create the css stylesheet.

The page is responsive based on breapoints at 600px, 900px, 1200px, and 1800px.
On 900px or less, the sub-nav menu becomes a dropdown toggle menu. This is done entirely with CSS.
There is one other breakpoint around 1445px for a spacing issue in the header.

The questions in the FAQ section can be toggled to expand or contract. This is also done entirely with CSS.

I began to add some hover effects to some of the links and buttons.


Thank you for taking the time to review this project!
